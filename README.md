You are a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest number of sales total price including tax.

# b) Defining the Metrics of Success

1. Dimensionality Reduction

Reducing the dataset to a low dimensional dataset using the t-SNE algorithm or PCA. 

2. Feature Selection

Performing feature selection through the use of the unsupervised learning methods.

3. Association Rules

Creating association rules that will allow you to identify relationships between variables in the dataset. 

4. Anomaly Detection

Checking whether there are any anomalies in the given sales dataset the objective being fraud detection.

# c) Understanding the context

You are a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). Your project has been divided into four parts where youâ€™ll explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on your insights.

# d) Recording the Experimental Design

1. Defining the question, the metric for success, the context and the experimental design.
2. Reading and exploring the dataset.
3. Reducing the dataset to a low dimensional dataset using the PCA.
4. Performing feature selection and providing insights on the features that contribute the most information to the dataset.
5. Creating association rules that will allow to identify relationships between variables in the dataset.
6. Identififying anomalies in the dataset which is fraud detection.

# e) Relevance of the data

The data used will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest number of sales and total price including tax.
